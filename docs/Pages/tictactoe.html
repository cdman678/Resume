<h1>TicTacToe Solver</h1>
<p>
    Below is the code for a TicTacToe solver that was designed to always either win or tie the opponent.<br>
    The trinket.io plugin supports running this code in the browser, however the time complexity of the <br>
    program will often timeout the browser. I recommend running this code locally.<br>
