<p>
    Below is the code for a Tic-tac-toe  solver that was designed to always either win or tie the opponent.
    The trinket.io plugin supports running this code in the browser, however the time complexity of the
    program will sometimes timeout the browser which will result in the code taking longer to run than it should.
    I recommend running this code locally. Additionally, the printed Tic-tac-toe  board looks a little messy when printed 
    through Trinket.io.
